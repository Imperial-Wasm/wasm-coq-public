Variable host_function : Type.

Let store_record := store_record host_function.

(** The application of a host function either:
  - returns [Some (st', result)], returning a new Wasm store and a result (which can be [Trap]),
  - diverges, represented as [None].
  This can be non-deterministic. **)

(** We provide two versions of the host.
  One based on a relation, to be used in the operational semantics,
  and one computable based on the [host_monad] monad, to be used in the interpreter.
  There is no host state in the host monad: it is entirely caught by the (state) monad. **)
